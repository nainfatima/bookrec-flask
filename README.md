# Book Recommender (Flask)

A lightweight Flask web module that recommends books by genre or author from an SQLite database—and even shows their cover images.

##  Features

- **Search by Genre**: Type a book title and get other books in the same genre.  
- **Search by Author**: See other books by the same author.  
- **Cover Images**: Each recommendation displays its book cover.  
- **Responsive UI**: Centered layout, card-style recommendations, and a soft background.  
- **Easy Setup**: No external database—uses SQLite and pure Python.
